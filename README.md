## Weather App using the Open Meteo Weather Forecast API

This is a Vanilla JavaScript App using Vite. The app calls the Open Meteo Weather Forecast API to retrieve weather data and display the data to the user. The basis for this project is a tutorial by WebDev Simplified. The app is enhanced by some mor styles, filtering possibilities for the hourly weather data and a chart displaying the daily weather data. Note that you have to enable the HTML Geolocator API to display the data.
The app is deployed to gh-pages under the link https://bernhard759.github.io/Vite-VanillaJS-App_weather_forecast/.
